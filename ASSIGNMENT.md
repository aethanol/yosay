# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I first spent a time looking at the readme on the npm/github page and starting to understand what the program did. It is described as: "Like cowsay, but less cow". Through google I found that cowsay is a program that generates an ASCII art cow with a message in a speech bubble. This program essentially does this but with the mascot of the yeoman scaffolding app. I then looked through the code and read the only comment block that was in the module to get a bigger picture of what was happening in the code. Though I probably should have been warned when the comment says: "What you're about to see may confuse you. And rightfully so. Here's an explanation." I then went through line by line thinking about what each function call was doing and built in my head a concept. When I was confused I wrote console.log messages to check variable changes. One aspect of the module that is easy to understand is the overall concept, it just makes ASCII art and prints a message. The code is more complicated then I fully understand though, and there are about 5 asynchronous functions that were kind of confusing, also .reduce() took me a bit to understand that it is basically an iteration.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Don't just regurgitate exactly what the code says. Put useful information that another programmer would understand, remember you aren't writing the comments for a normal layman user but are writing comments for yourself and for other people changing your code in the future. Think about how how abstraction can better explain how something works. Explain how things interact together, and broadly show how something works rather than go line by line on what each command is doing. I would also say if you can read the code without needing further explination, you might not need a comment at all!


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent about 6 hours on the assignment proper, plus a couple of days mulling over options of modules to document.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I used the npm and github pages of the yosay module. I also used the mozilla JS documentation on some of the specific functions that the program uses, like .reduce() and .split() for dealing with strings and arrays. I also looked up regular expression codes and what //s means or /./d means. I honestly don't fully grasp this yet, but I think I get the basic concept of matching characters and text in strings.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Not particularly, though it would have been very helpful to have understood JS code more before diving into this assignment. I don't fully understand asynchronous programming yet, nor fully grasp the concept of regular expressions which were very important in yosay.
